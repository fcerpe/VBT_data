We assessed that accuracy and timings (reading, writing) across sessions do not 
differ between groups (Braille v. Connected-Braille).
Here we want to assess the role played by the statistics of the stimuli learned.

Questions:
    - how do they learn? 
    
    - which statistics play a role in learning (a.k.a which are correlated)?
        * word frequency
        * word length
        * word orthographic neighbours
        * word phonologic neighbours
        * letter frequency
        * letter neighbours (shape-based)
        
    - are there differences in testing due to the nature of the stimulus seen?
        * seen words
        * novel words
        * pseudo-words


To operationalize, this function computes the followin statistics: 
    - TBD
