%% VISUAL BRAILLE TRAINING - DATA CLEANING
% 
% Main script to extract information from raw data
%
% From inputs data (extracted from Pavlovia), take the subjects that have
% completed the experiment and "preprocess" / clean the results and log
% tables.

% Â© Filippo Cerpelloni


% Clean workspae and command window
clean;
clc;

% Load bidspm for secondary subfunctions 
addpath '../lib/bidspm'
addpath(genpath(pwd))
bidspm;

% get option
opt = clean_option();


%% Extract data from raw
% For each subject:
% - extract data from the four different days of training
% - import each csv and extract the meaningful responses (for accuracy)
% - import log file and extract timings
% - save relevant files in /outputs/extracted_data/subID 

% !!! manually make folders for each day and script, plus discarded one

% GO CHECK DATA OF PILOTS

% Load folders 

% go through folders

% Check if participant exists - function

% Load one file (two separate lists for csv and logs, ideally with the same
% indexes)

% Import csv - function, calls trim csv function that trims it

% Import log - function, calls trim log function that trims it

% save files in corresponding 'preproc' folder

%% Make summary for JASP / R (separate function)

% Get files from each preprocessed sub

% Make data into new file in new format:
% sub, script, ACCURACIES
% day1: time reading training, time checking training, time reading test, 
%       time checking test
% day2: time reading refresh, time checking refresh, time reading training, 
%       time checking training, time writing training, time reading test, 
%       time checking test
% day3: time reading training, time checking training, time writing training, 
%       time reading test, time checking test
% day4: time reading training, time checking training, time writing training, 
%       time reading test, time checking test
